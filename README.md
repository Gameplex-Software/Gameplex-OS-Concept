# Gameplex-OS-Concept
Virtual Reality, fully immersive operating system


## Concept
 Imagine sittingn down not to two or more monitors but to a headset. When you place this VR headset on your head you enter a full 360 degree desktop environment where you can open and interact with windows suspended in mid-air, type on a virtual keyboard and use a virtual mouse. You are no longer limited to the space on your monitors, you can have a full sphere of windows open or just a single one, play back 2D content in windowed format or watch a 360 YouTube Video as if you are in it. You can play games and message friends without leaving VR and create, edit, and view 3D models and animations in real time in an immersed and interactive interface. Imagine if you could talk to friends face-to-face in a virtual environment of your chioce or give a presentation to them in a virtual theatre.
